![Node.js CI](https://github.com/JosephusPaye/lookup-lyrics/workflows/Node.js%20CI/badge.svg)

ðŸŽ¶ Lookup lyrics of songs using online sources. Designed for use in Node.js (v10 and above).

This project is part of [#CreateWeekly](https://twitter.com/JosephusPaye/status/1214853295023411200), my attempt to create something new publicly every week in 2020.

## How it works

Lookup provides a common interface for looking up song lyrics using various online sources. An adapter is used to implement this interface for each source. Currently, the available sources are:

- [Genius](https://genius.com/)

## Installation

```
npm install @josephuspaye/lookup-lyrics --save
```

## Usage

### Look up lyrics

The following example looks up lyrics of the song _Happy_ by Pharrell Williams:

```js
const { getLyrics } = require('@josephuspaye/lookup-lyrics');

async function main() {
  try {
    const lyrics = await getLyrics('happy', 'pharrell williams');
    console.log(JSON.stringify(lyrics, null, '  '));
  } catch (error) {
    console.log('unable to look up lyrics', error);
  }
}

main();
```

    source?: LookupLyrics.Source;
  }
): Promise<LookupLyrics.LyricsResult>;
```

The following types are used for parameters and return values.

```ts
namespace LookupLyrics {
  /**
   * The sources available for looking up lysics.
   */
  type Source = 'genius';

  /**
   * The available languages
   */
  type Language = 'en';

  /**
   * Result of looking up lyrics
   */
  interface LyricsResult {
    /**
     * Attribution for where the lyrics are from
     */
    attribution: string;

    /**
     * The title of the song
     */
    song: string;

    /**

     */
    artist?: string;

    /**

    album?: string;

    /**
     * The lyrics text
     */
    lines: string;
  }
}
```

`getLyrics()` may throw errors matching the following interface:

```ts
/**
 * A look up error.
 */
interface Error {
  originalError?: any;
  message?: string;
  type: ErrorType;
}
```

Where `type` is a member of the following enum:

```ts
/**
 * The errors that could occur when looking up lyrics.
 */
enum ErrorType {
  /**
   * The given song is empty
   */
  'SONG_EMPTY' = 'SONG_EMPTY',

  /**
   * The given artist is empty
   */
  'ARTIST_EMPTY' = 'ARTIST_EMPTY',

  /**
   * Request to the source website failed
   */
  'SOURCE_REQUEST_FAILED' = 'SOURCE_REQUEST_FAILED',

  /**
   * The given source was not recognized
   */
  'UNKNOWN_SOURCE' = 'UNKNOWN_SOURCE',

  /**
   * The given song was not found on the source page: perhaps the page format changed
   */
  'NOT_FOUND' = 'NOT_FOUND',

  /**
   * Unable to extract the lyrics from the source page
   */
  'EXTRACTION_FAILED' = 'EXTRACTION_FAILED',

```
